 ;; === DISEQUALITY ===
 ;; =/= can only simplify ==->fail (with different ground) and =/=->succeed (with identical everything). It can be simplified by ==->fail (different ground) and anything else->succeed.
 ;; g contains no information when c is conjoined with a non-disj that reduces it -> succeed.
 ;; a disj simplifies g->trivial when each branch either succeeds or fails, so each branch either fails with == or succeeds with anything
 ;; g simplifies a disj when any branch either fails with ==, or succeeds with an identical =/=.
 ;; if all disj branches fail, we can fail and continue
 ;; problems arise when all disj branches simplify g, and g simplifies any disj branch
 ;; theres also a problem if we have x=/=1 and a disj with a branch x1==x2 & x2==2, although can that happen if the constraint is normalized? we may not need to solve disj branches beyond the first bc they wont be normalized
 ;; we need to add an asymmetric flag where asymmetric successes (=/= and maybe pconstraint and matcho) dont fire inside disj. that way we can use the asymmetry to simplify stored disj without skipping fresh constraints
 ;; can we just skip disj in one direction since failure is symmetric always? no because two symbolos in a disj might cancel a new diseq
